      [Loomio
      open-source software
      for collaborative decision-making]
    t02: "The world needs a better way to make decisions together. The internet is changing what’s possible."
    t03: "[REAL DEMOCRACY NEEDS TO INCLUDE EVERYONE]"
    t04: "[DEMOCRACY = COLLABORATION.]"
    t05: "[LET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN TOGETHER.]"
    t06: "Hi I’m ALANNA. I’m part of a small team of open-source developers, facilitators and activists here in New Zealand."
    t07: We’re working on a project called Loomio.
    t08: "It’s a simple online tool for collaborative decision-making."
    t09: "Hi I’m RICHARD. when I got involved in the Occupy movement I experienced how massively empowering it can be when everyone’s voice is included in a decision-making process."
    t10: "But if it can only happen in person, it can never work at a large scale."
    t11: "It seems crazy, but there’s no easy way to make decisions together online."
    t12: "Email and social media just weren’t built for bringing online discussion to clear agreement."
    t13: "It’s like this missing piece of the Internet, that we need for turning online talk into real-world action."
    t14: "So that’s what we’ve been working on for the past 18 months."
    t15: "As soon as we released our prototype, we were swamped by thousands of groups around the world - from student movements and City Councils, to software projects and community groups."
    t16: "We’ve learned a lot from all the people doing great things with the prototype."
    t17: "We know its potential, and we know its limitations."
    t18: "Now it’s time to build the real thing."
    t19: "Loomio 1.0 - a tool for truly inclusive decision-making."
    t20: "At its core, it’s actually really simple:"
    t21: "you talk things through and hear different perspectives,"
    t22: "build agreement and work through any concerns,"
    t23: "and decide a clear course of action that works for everyone."
    t24: "This flexible, dynamic process unlocks collective wisdom, coming to better outcomes together than any individual would have on their own."
    t25: "[Mobile]"
    t26: "Loomio 1.0 will work on all devices, opening it up to parts of the world where computers are scarce."
    t27: "[Safe]"
    t28: "You can host it yourself, to take complete control of your own privacy."
    t29: "[Easy]"
    t30: "[Accessible]"
    t31: "Most importantly, it’s designed to be super easy to use and accessible, so anyone can participate."
    t32: "Loomio will always be free and open-source software."
    t33: "We're building public infrastructure for decision-making, held in the commons."
    t34: "By resourcing Loomio through crowdfunding, the project can be driven by the community of people who want it to happen, not by advertisers, or people who want to sell your data."
    t35: "We’ve done all the research and design, and now we  just have to build it."

    t36a: "An amazing crew has come together with exactly the right skills to make this happen: a development team that’s passionate about user-centred design, coupled with group process experts with decades of facilitation experience."
    t36b: "To take this next step, the core team needs to dedicate all of their time to it without worrying about how they’re going to feed themselves."

    t37: "And that’s why right now we need your help."
    t38: "We’re embracing the gift economy and asking for your support, so we can give something amazing back to the world."
    t39: "You’re not just supporting a vision, you’re getting a tool that will make a difference in your own life, in your work, and in your community."
    t40: "So it’s up to all of us."
    t41: "Will this missing piece of the internet be developed on open platforms, for the public good?"
    t42: "You can help to make that decision right now, by giving to this project."
    t43: "[Support Loomio]"
    t44: "[Share this campaign]"
